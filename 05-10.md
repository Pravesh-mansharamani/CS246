# Last class brush up

```c++
struct Node{
    void swap(Node &other){
        std::swap(data, other.data);
        std::swap(next, other.next);
    }

    Node &operator=(const node &other){
        Node tmp{other};
        swap(tmp);
        return *this;
    }
};
```

# Move ctor-Rvalues
- Recall Lvalues: Long lasting, memory address that we can get with &(address of)
<br>

```c++
Node oddsOrEvens(){
    Node o{1, {new Node{3, new Node{5, ... new Node{99, nullptr}}}}};
    Node e{2, {new Node{4, new Node{6, ... new Node{100, nullptr}}}}};
    char c;
    cin >> c;
    return (c == 'o') ? o : e;
}

Node l = oddsOrEvens(); //Return by value (copy ctor)
```

- We copy 50 nodes to create l. Then, o goes out of scope, and we delete those 50 Nodes we just copied from. Why copy Nodes just to delete originals immediately after.

- We can steel data from another object as long as we know that object will no longer be used. We need a way to determine if a parameter is an Lvalue(lonh-lasting, must copy), or an value(temporary), then we can steal data(rvlaues).

- Node&& -> This is an Rvalue reference binds to temporaries. We can overload our ctor:
```c++ 
Node(const Node &other) // Copy ctor
Node(Node &&other) //Move ctor
```
<br>

```c++
struct Node{
    Node(Node &&other) : data{other.data}, next{other.next} {
        other.next = nullptr;
    }
}
```
<br>

- how to now if the value is lvalue or rvalue : it always depends on how long are we going to use it, when does it go out of scope, etc. There is a lot of things but we just need to know a few; for more go to c++website.

# Move Assignment Operator:

```c++
struct Node{
    Node &operator=(Node &&other){
        swap(other);
        return *this;
    }
};

Node n{1, new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};
n = oddsOrEvens();  // Rvalue move assignment operator
```
<br>

- If you write move ctor/move assignment operator - These are used instade of copies where possible, If you write copy ctor/assignment operator, but no more version - copying version always used.

<br>

# Rule of the Big 5 (Suggestion):
- If you write one of dtor, ctor, copy ctor, copy assignment operator, move ctor, move assignment operator; You should probably write all 5 of them.

- Only write them if the complier provided versions are incorrect. Often write the Big 5 for classes with ownership - classes that manages a resource(like memory).

<br>

# Elision:

```c++
Vec getVec() {return {0,0};}
Vec v = getVec(); // what happens ?! Basic ctor, no move/copy
```
- In certain cases, Complier can perform something called move/copy elision. Rather than constructing Vec in getVec and moving it, Simply write values into main stack frame. Can happen even if it changes output of program!


### Other example:
```c++
void useVec(Vec v);
useVec({1,2});    //Elison happens, one ctor is run, basic ctor.
```
- Not expecting us to know exactly all the places where elision may occur, just that it's possible.

# Member Operators (Revisited)

Note: Previously we wrote operator overloads outside struct Operator=, we wrote as a method.

- If we wrote operator overload as methods, this becomes LHS parameter.

<br>

```c++
struct Vec{
    int x, y;
    Vec operator+(const Vec &other){
        return {x + other.x, y + other.y};
    }

    Vec operator*(int k){
        return {x * k, y * k};
    }  // This only supports v*k 
};  // To support k * v - must write a standalone function as before.
```

#### Advice :
For arithmetic assignment, implement one using the other:
```c++
Vec &operator+=(Vec &v1, Vec &v2) {
    v1.x += v2.x;
    v1.y += v2.y;
    return v1;
}

Vec operator+(const Vec& v1, const Vec &v2) {
    Vec tmp{v1};
    return temp+=vz;
}
```

## I/O Operators:
```c++
struct Vec{
    ostream & operator<<(ostream &out) {
        return cout << x << " " << y;   
    }
};

//v << cout -> not intuitive we should also add one more arg (ostream &Vec) to avoid the issue
```
- I/o operator's must be defined as standalone fucntions. Operator overloads that must be methods:
    - operator=
    - opertaor[]
    - operator->
    - operator()
    - operator T    //where T is a type.
