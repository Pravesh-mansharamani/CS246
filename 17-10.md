### Today
- Array of objects, const objects, static, 3-way comparison.


## Array of Objects:

```c++
struct Vec{
    int x,y;
    Vec(int x, int y) : x {x}, y {y} {}
};
//neither will complie
Vec *vp = new Vec[15];
Vec array[10];       
```

When we creste an array if objects, default ctor will run for each object in the array. No default ctor => no compilation.

##### Solutions:
1. Add a default ctor back, so it can be called for each element in the array. If *NO* default ctor makes sense, then what?

2. Stack Allocated arrays, given inital vectors.
```c++
Vec array[3] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};
```
But, What if we need heap allocation.

3. Use an array of pointers
```c++
Vec **vp = new Vec *[15];  //heap
Vec *array[10]; //stack

vp[0] = new Vec{0, 1};
vp[1] = new Vec{2, 3};  //remeber: vp[1] = *(vp + 1)

for(int i  = 0; i< 15; ++i) delete vp[i];
delete[]vp;
```

## Const Object:
Object can be const. Used most commonly in the form of const lvalue refreneces.
```c++
const Student s{60, 70, 80};
s.assns = 80;  // will not compile
cout << s.grade() << endl;  // Does not compile
```
The compiler doesn't know wheather or not s.grade() will modify the feilds. Calling s.grade() with a const s is not allowed.

```c++
struct Student{
    int assns, mt, final;
    float grade() const; //This const indicates that grade will not modify any fields.
    float Student::grade() const {
        return assns*0.4 + mt*0.2 + final*0.4;
    }  
    // constess is a part of the method's signature - must appear in both interface and implementaion.

    const Student s{60, 70, 80};

    cout << s.grade() <<endl; // now will complie
};
```
Only const methods can be called const objects.

<br>
Imagine collecting stats on our program:

```c++
struct Student{
    int assns, mt, final, calls;

    float grade() const {
        ++calls;   // wont compile
        return assns*0.4 + mt*0.2 + final*0.4;
    }
};
```
Issue, physical vs logical constness

##### Physical Constness:
Makeing sure that the bits that make the object do not change.

##### Logical Constness:
Making sure the "essence" or the feilds and memory we care about dont change.

##### Solution:
Declare calls s *mutable*;
```c++
struct Student{
    int assns, mt, final;
    mutable int call; 
    //^This feild may be changed even for a const object or const method.
    float grade() const {
        ++calls;   // will compile now
        return assns*0.4 + mt*0.2 + final*0.4;
    }
}
```
Advice : Use mutable sparingly, decreases usefullness of const.

## Static fields/static methods
Issue: calls is tracked separated for each student what if I want it shared among all students? Declare a static feild - shared among all instances of the class.

```c++
struct Student{
    inline static int numInstances = 0;  // using static shares amongest all students 
    // inline allows us to init numInstances to 0
    Student(int assns, int mt, int final) : assns{assns}, mt{mt}, final{final} {
        ++numInstances;
    }
};

Student s{{1, 2, 3};
Student t{4, 5, 6};

cout << Student::numInstances < endl; // will print out 2
```
Static methods: Called on the class itself, rather than any particular object - can only access static feilds.

```c++
struct Student{
    static void howMany() {
        cout << numInstances << endl;
    }
};

Student s{60, 70, 80};
Student::howMany();
```

## 3 Way Comparison:
Recall string comparison in C:

```c
strcmp(s1, s2)

// Lexograhical order
// < 0 if s1 < s2
// == 0 if s1 == s2
// > 0 if s1 > s2
```

In c:
```c
int n = strcmp(" ", " ");
if (n < 0){
} else if (n == 0){
} else {
}
// Only one compairison
```

In c++:

```c++
if (s1 < s2) {
} else if (s1 == s2) {
} else {
}
// 2 compairsions instade of 1 in C , slower than C
```

Can achive this in c++ -> yes, as of c++ 20 we can do this with the 3-way comparison operator: <=> (also called as spaceship operator).

```c++
import <compare>
string s1 = "...", s2 = "...";
std::strong_ordering n = (s1 <=> s2);

// n < 0, s1 < s2
// n == 0, s1 == s2
// n > 0, s1 > s2 
```

std::strong_ordering ->  This is a long type name. To avoid writing it out, use automatic type deduction: 
```c++
auto n = (s1 <=> s2);
//n gets the type of the expression on the RHS;
```

Example: Write <=> for Vec.
```c++
struct Vec{
    int x, y;
    auto operator <=> (const Vec &other) const{
        auto n = (x <=> other.x);
        return (n = 0) ? y <=> other.y : n;
    }
};
```
Having written "<=>" for Vecs, I can now do:
v1 <=> v2, v1 != v2, v1 == v2, v1 <= v2, v1 >= v2, v1 > v2, v1 < v2.
All of these are given for fre by compiler.
