## Today:
Aggregartion, Specialization (Inheritance)

## Class Relationships:
Compostion : If class A "owns-a" class B :
   - A is copied => B is copied.
   - A dies => B dies.
   - B has no identity without A.

Aggregation : If class A "has-a" class B : "Has-a" relationship.
   - A is copied => B isn't copied. (Shallow copy)
   - A dies => B lives.
   - B has an identity without A.


```c++
class Student{
    university *myUni;
    
    public:
        Student(university *myUni) : myUni{myUni} {}
};

int main(){
    university uw {...};
    Student s1{&uw};
    Student s2{&uw};
}
```

Typically - "Aggrigation" is, done via pointers or references. But not always.

## Specialization (Inheritance): 
Consider a library program that catalogs manages books.

```c++
class Book{
    string title, author;
    int length;
    public:
        Book(...) {...}
};

class Text{
    string title, author;
    int length;
    string topic;
    public:
        Text(...) {...}
};
```

|   Comic     |               |
|-------------|---------------|
| Title       | string        |
| Author      | string        |
| Length      | integer       |
| Hero        | string        |


How can I create an array of books, which could each be a regular book, a Textbook or a comic book?
<br>
Issue : c++ is not aware of the relationship between these classes.
        Text and comics are types of books. They are "specializations" of books.
        A Text "is-a" book, a comic "is-a" book.

<br>
To create an array of texts/books/comics : 

1. Use an Union type:
```c++
union Book{
    Book *b;
    Text *t;
    Comic *c;
};

BookPointer bp;
bp.b = new Book{...};

cout << bp.t->topic <<endl;
```
Union are only large enough to store one particular type, we can freely convert between these diffrent types. With no regards for safety. - not good


2. Use an array of void *s:

Void * s may point to anything - Type unsafe.

We must make complier aware of the relationship between these classes.("is-a" relationship)?
can do so with "inheritance".

```c++
class Book{
    string title, author;
    int length;
    public:
        Book(string title, string author, int length) : title{title}, author{author}, length{length} {}
};

class Text : public Book{  //Text "is-a" book.
    string topic;
    public:
        Text(string title, string author, int length, string topic) : {...}
};

class Comic : public Book{  //Comic "is-a" book.
    string hero;
    public:
        Comic(string title, string author, int length, string hero) : {...}
};

// Text and comic are derived or subclasses of book.
```
Subclass Inherit feilds and methods from superclass. Text and comic have these feilds and methods i.e title, author and length. In Book : Title, author and length are **PRIVATE**. Only accessible in book methods, but not in Text or Comic methods.

<br>

```c++
class Text : public Book {  //Text "is-a" book.
    string topic;
    public:
        Text(string title, string author, int length, string topic) : title{title}, author{author}, length{length}, topic{topic} {}
};
```

The above method wouldn't work for 2 reasons:
1. Text doesn't have access to Book's private feilds i.e title, author and length. And in MIL you may only set feilds of the class, 
    feilds not of superclass.

2. Object creation sequence

<br>

Updated object creation sequence:
1. Space is allocated.
2. Superclass constructor runs (new).
3. Feilds are initiated (MIL).
4. constructor body runs.

If we don't specify arguments for superclass constructor, Then when step 2 runs, we will attempt to default construct the book part of the text. Books's doesn't have a default constructor. So we get an error => no compilation.

#### Solution :
```c++
class Text : public Book { // This works!
    string topic;
    public:
        Text(string title, string author, int length, string topic) : Book{title, author, length}, topic{topic} {}
};
```
In general, we do prefer to keep superclass feilds private, There os however another way to access specifier called "protected". Protected feilds are accessible in any subclasses and class.

<br>

Consider: Adding multiple authors to a text.
```c++
class Book{
    protected:
        string title, author;
        int length;
    public:
        Book(...) {...}
};


class Text : public Book {
    string topic;
    public:
        Text(...) {...}
        void addAuthor(string author) {
            this->author += ", " + author;
        } // author is protected in Book, so we can access it here.
};
```

Better to use protected setter methods, rather than protected feilds.

```c++
class Book{
    string title, author;
    int length;
    protected:
        void setTitle(string t) {title = t;}
        void setAuthor(string a) {author = a;}
        void setLength(int len) {length = len;}
    public:
        Book(...) {...}
}; // Subclasses call thos methods rather than setting author directly, or use any other method to set feilds.
```
